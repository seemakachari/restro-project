I have designed a  restaurant landing page using semantic HTML &amp; CSS. Here i have implemented a sticky header and beautiful hero section using transition properties.  Added three carts for displaying features. And Created a picturesque menu presenting food gallery using CSS Grid System as well as applied hover animation.
